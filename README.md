# 🕹️ Stick Hero Game

A fun and addictive mini-game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

In **Stick Hero**, your goal is to help the hero cross from one platform to another using a stick. Press and hold to stretch the stick, release to drop it — but be careful! If the stick is too short or too long, the hero will fall.
